Let us now introduce a very special --ticker-mode called 'test' and for that please provide for me a set of test data that will will install into TEST\\\_DATA\\\_DIR = "test\\\_data" And have it in the identical file names and format that we use for historical\\\_data. The only difference is that you will make this data will emulate a real live situation where 10 readings come in for each pair, and then after the 10th reading of each of those pairs the next set of pairs present a arbitrage trading opportunity. You will then generate the same output that would happen as if this was in 'live' --ticker-mode with the --dry-run set to TRUE and show the user the results of the trades and which trades they were.
