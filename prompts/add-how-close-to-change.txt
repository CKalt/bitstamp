Please analyze this trading system code and suggest ways for including, as part
of the status command, a description of how close we are to having a trade
signal. We only implement a ma crossover strategy today (correct me if I'm
wrong) so you may address your solution for just this strategy as we will be
adding future strategies that will require a change to this "how close are we"
description. So your solution should be tailored to expanding for other strategies.

Include this description as part of the "status short" a description for how
close we are to a change from short to long or a long to short.
